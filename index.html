            <p>The honey badger is part of the weasel family, related to skunks, otters, ferrets, and other badgers. Its
                proper name is ratel, but it gets the common name honey badger from what seems to be its favorite food:
                honey. Yet what the animal is actually looking to eat are the bee larvae found in the honey!</p>
            <p>This tough little critter has a stocky, flattened body with short, strong legs, along with long claws on
                the front feet for digging and defense. The honey badger's hair is thick and coarse, mostly black, with
                a wide gray-white stripe that stretches across its back from the top of the head to the tip of the tail.
